## HTTPS/TLS

In order to enable HTTPS, the `HTTPS_CERTFILE` and `HTTPS_KEYFILE` environment variables must be set. During development, this may be set to the self-signed certificate that comes with the repository:

```bash
$ export HTTPS_CERTFILE=cert/selfsigned.pem
$ export HTTPS_KEYFILE=cert/selfsigned_key.pem
$ mix phx.server
```

WARNING: only use the generated certificate for testing in a closed network environment, such as running a development RIG instance on localhost. For production, staging, or testing on the public internet, obtain a proper certificate, for example from [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

For production you should use proper HTTPS certificates instead (for that reason the Docker image comes without certificates).

1. Create your own not-selfsigned certificate
2. Store it on your machine
3. Run the docker image by mounting the files as shown here:

```bash
$ docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)"/cert/not-selfsigned.pem:/cert/not-selfsigned.pem \
  -e HTTPS_CERTFILE=/cert/not-selfsigned.pem \
  -v "$(pwd)"/cert/not-selfsigned_key.pem:/cert/not-selfsigned_key.pem \
  -e HTTPS_KEYFILE=/cert/not-selfsigned_key.pem \
  -p 4000:4000 -p 4010:4010 \
  accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway
```

Refer to the [RIG operator guide](rig-ops-guide.md) to learn more about available configuration options.
