RIG exposes its API documentation on its API endpoint under [/swagger-ui](http://localhost:4010/swagger-ui). For integration into an existing swagger UI, the related JSON document can either be [retrieved at runtime](http://localhost:4010/swagger-ui/rig_api_swagger.json) or found on disk at `priv/static/rig_api_swagger.json` after compiling RIG at least once.
