## What to look out for

Dear reviewer, I want you to

- gain knowledge - I think it's important for you to know about the change.
- check that the code works on your machine.
- suggest implementation-code design/structure/readability improvements.
- suggest test-code design/structure/readability improvements.
- suggest documentation improvements.
- suggest language/writing improvements.
- help to find bugs (described below!).

> Hint: remove anything you don't need and use `@` mentions for "assigning" tasks to different people

> Hint: if you find yourself adding the same "task" more than once, consider adding it to the [pull-request template](https://github.com/Accenture/reactive-interaction-gateway/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request.md).

## Process

The goal is to improve not only the code in this PR but also our skills! The "rules":

- The review is considered "done" as soon as all reviewers have added their review, and all their comments have been addressed.
- For knowledge-sharing reviews, each reviewer should "approve" the PR after studying its content.
- After the approval, the merge is concluded by the developer.

Have fun!
